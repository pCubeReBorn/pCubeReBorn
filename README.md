### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a CSE undergrad at UIU.  
I enjoy embedded systems where software and hardware meet.  
I learn, forget, and continue — and I like problem-solving in coding, math, and robotics.

### 🔭 Current Focus
- Embedded systems & robotics (ESP32 / STM32 / Arduino)
- Communication: CAN / UART / I2C / SPI
- Building better habits through small projects
